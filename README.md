# Credit_Risk_Analysis
##	Overview of the analysis: 
 I have used the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, 
 - I ahve used oversample the data by using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. 
 - The combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm were used for Delivable 2. 
 - For Delivable 3 I compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 
 
## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
##	Summary
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
